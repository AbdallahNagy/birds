by using tables elements in html, i was able to make the layout of the whole page just by one single table.

you might wonder why i'm doing that. it's because i'm taking html course right now and it was assignment to do it

i know nobody do that in real life (they ues grids) but we're practicing html as mush as we could. and its pretty fun.
